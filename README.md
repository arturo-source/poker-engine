# Poker Engine
Poker engine is a library written in Golang. It can be used to build:
- A game REST API using the Go HTTP standard library.
- An AI that learns using Reinforcement Learning.
- A poker-odds application ([CLI example](https://github.com/arturo-source/poker-odds)).

Ensure the library is installed:
```bash
go get -u github.com/arturo-source/poker-engine/
```

If you want to know how to use this library, you can see tests. I plan adding some documentation in the future.
